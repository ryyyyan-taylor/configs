# Configs

Config files for my tools I use between all my machines. Mostly for my sake to make syncing my configs easy.

## Files

### Alacritty
My terminal of choice. This is almost entirely the default config, other than importing my color scheme defined in `dracula.yml` and adding transparency.

### Tmux, Vim
Standard terminal applications I use. I don't use vim much anymore as I prefer micro, however having my few config changes synced is a huge help. Tmux I use ALL the time and the keybindings from Nick Jannetakis work super well for me.

### City jpg
My favorite wallpaper, I use this on every system I have.

### Fish, Bash
Standard configs for my shells. After living in Fish for about a year but recently I've been back to Bash fulltime just for simplicity sake.
